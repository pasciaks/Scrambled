This scrambled game is intended for really EVERYONE at the same time.  Live many players.  ( Many families now each have their own smart phone, and they often are seen sitting in the same room on their phone and not interacting with each other.  With this http://publicpuzzle.com concept, they now can play instantly together.  This has been part of http://lostwords.org (which has 5 overhead display modes) and was the key ingredient to our Hackriddle jigsaw puzzle (everyone together building a live jigsaw puzzle ).

I just have to get some design and game theory people to help turn it into a profitable adventure.
